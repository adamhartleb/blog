      <description>What is TypeScript? TypeScript is a transpile-to-JavaScript language meaning that a program written in Typescript must first be translated (transpiled) to JavaScript before it can be run in the browser. Although compiling typically has a different meaning, the TypeScript community refers to this process as compilation. Why would anyone want to go through this process though? Because TypeScript comes with a host of features on top of those already available in JavaScript, all aimed at making writing JavaScript code more robust.</description>
