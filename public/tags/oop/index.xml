      <description>Introduction What exactly is an object? An object is defined by two components: properties and behaviors. A car has properties like its color, the year it was made, if it&amp;rsquo;s 4WD or not, etc. It also has behaviors such as starting, driving and so on. Having both of these components is key because if you just have behaviors then you&amp;rsquo;re simply dealing with functions that transform their inputs and return the output.</description>
