https://rustup.rs/
And following the onscreen instructions. You can confirm that the installation has worked by running:
rustc --version The rustup installation also comes with another command line tool called cargo which is the Rust packager manager &ndash; akin to npm for Node. Rust packages are called crates and there is an online repository of crates visible here:<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/rust/">rust</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/intro/">intro</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/intro-to-typescript/">
            <p class="note title">Intro to Typescript - Getting Started</p><p class="note date">Monday, February 24, 2020</p><p class="note content">What is TypeScript? TypeScript is a transpile-to-JavaScript language meaning that a program written in Typescript must first be translated (transpiled) to JavaScript before it can be run in the browser. Although compiling typically has a different meaning, the TypeScript community refers to this process as compilation. Why would anyone want to go through this process though? Because TypeScript comes with a host of features on top of those already available in JavaScript, all aimed at making writing JavaScript code more robust.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/typescript/">typescript</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/intro/">intro</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/intro-to-oop/">

An object is defined by two components: properties and behaviors. A car has properties like its color, the year it was made, if it&rsquo;s 4WD or not, etc. It also has behaviors such as starting, driving and so on. Having both of these components is key because if you just have behaviors then you&rsquo;re simply dealing with functions that transform their inputs and return the output.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/oop/">oop</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/intro/">intro</a></p></li></ul></div><section id="footer" class="footer"><div class="footer-wrap">
