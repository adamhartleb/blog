      <description>Installing and configuring Rust is a breeze with rustup which is an installer for Rust. You can download it by visiting:
https://rustup.rs/
And following the onscreen instructions. You can confirm that the installation has worked by running:
rustc --version The rustup installation also comes with another command line tool called cargo which is the Rust packager manager &amp;ndash; akin to npm for Node. Rust packages are called crates and there is an online repository of crates visible here:</description>

      <description>What is TypeScript? TypeScript is a transpile-to-JavaScript language meaning that a program written in Typescript must first be translated (transpiled) to JavaScript before it can be run in the browser. Although compiling typically has a different meaning, the TypeScript community refers to this process as compilation. Why would anyone want to go through this process though? Because TypeScript comes with a host of features on top of those already available in JavaScript, all aimed at making writing JavaScript code more robust.</description>

      <description>Introduction What exactly is an object? An object is defined by two components: properties and behaviors. A car has properties like its color, the year it was made, if it&amp;rsquo;s 4WD or not, etc. It also has behaviors such as starting, driving and so on. Having both of these components is key because if you just have behaviors then you&amp;rsquo;re simply dealing with functions that transform their inputs and return the output.</description>
