### Interface vs Implementation

In the previous post, we used a car's steering wheel and pedal as an example of an interface. The interface provides a way to steer and drive the car forward without knowing how that is _implemented_. You could have a typical gas or diesel engine or it could be a battery, the point is the object interacting with the interface does not care as long as it works. A change in the implementation should have no effect on the driver of the car.
