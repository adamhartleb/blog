WebGL is a graphics library that allows browsers to render 3D scenes. Rendering is the process of creating an image from a model using a computer program. There are three main categories of rendering: software/hardware-based, client/server-based and retained/immediate-mode rendering. 

The first category pertains to the hardware we are using. If all the calculations required to render a 3D scene are done on the CPU, it is referred to as software-based rendering. If the rendering involves the use of a GPU, then it is considered hardware-base rendering. The latter is much more efficient because it has dedicated hardware to support the necessary operations. 

The second category is whether the rendering is happening locally on our machine or remotely and then sent over the network. Server based rendering is
