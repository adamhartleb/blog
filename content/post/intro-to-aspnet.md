Microsoft has been providing web development focused ASP.NET programming models since 2002 with the inception of ASP.NET Web Forms. It allowed developers to build websites similarly to how they would build desktop applications using Windows Forms. This was an inadequate solution though as it provided limited control over what HTML, CSS and JavaScript was addded to the browser. Additionally, since it ran on the .NET framework, it could only be developed and ran on Windows.

The second iteration was ASP.NET MVC which used the Model-View-Controller pattern popularized by frameworks like Ruby on Rails. It improved on the Web Forms in almost every way, but it was still tied to the .NET Framework so you had to have a Windows server to deploy your application. 

In 2015 the ASP.NET Core MVC model was released which again improved on ASP.NET MVC and now provided cross-platform capabilities as well as an open-source code base.
